# Mapping_Earthquakes
##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

##Tasks
To complete this project, we called earthquake data from various websites to create a map with 4 layers of data related to earthquakes over the last 30 days. 

Approach
JavaScript and the D3.js library was used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. The four maps layers show fault lines from the tectonic plates, all earthquakes for the last 7 days, significant earthquakes from the last 30 days, and earthquakes above 4.5 magnitude for the last 7 days.
